The ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ or the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ Realms, sometimes just referred to as the Four ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓, are a group of human states north of the Amell mountains. Their inhabitants are called Nordlings by the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ians (both the ones from the core of the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓, and from the conquered provinces). Aside from humans, a number of dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings live in the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ as second-class citizens.

The ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ were invaded and partially conquered by the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ian ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓.

During the Third ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ War, only King ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ V of Redania remained of all the crowned heads of the major ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓. For this reason, during this war the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ were known as ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓'s Realms.

In 1263, the First ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ War broke out when the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ian Army, led by ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓, crossed the Amell Mountains, on the orders of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, into the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓.

▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ quickly took control of Marnadal, then slaughtered ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓, causing the suicide of Calanthe. They then marched north into Sodden, taking control of Upper Sodden in a quick battle with a ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ army. From there the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ians crossed the Yaruga into Lower Sodden and were defeated in a massive battle, which resulted in more than 30,000 deaths and the defeat of the ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ian forces back past the mountains.
